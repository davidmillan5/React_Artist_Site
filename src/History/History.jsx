              David Martínez Álvarez, known as Rayden, is a Madrid MC, singer,
              producer and writer originally from Alcalá de Henares. Although he
              is known today mainly for his solo albums and books, he has also
              worked very successfully with various groups such as A3Bandas or
              Crew Cuervos and became the winner of the well-known freestyle
              competition Red Bull's Battle of the Roosters. His first steps in
              music that came to be perceived by the public, were with Dj Mesh
              and Lumier around 2001, in a group that would call Assamitas and
              later would be known as A3Bandas. After a couple of demos like
              "Técnicas de ataque" or "No hay simil" that they would release
              after winning the "Proyecto demo" of Lebuqe, appears "Zigurat", a
              demo that catapulted the fame of the group to the greatest heights
              of the Spanish undergound and would help them to sign with Boa
              Musica, and release a maxi and the first LP of the group "Galería
              de héroes", one of the best Rap albums of 2008. Although there
              would be a lot of talk about a second album, it would never be
              released, and today a new work of the group is excluded.

              This success as a group would be followed by a period in which
              Rayden would increasingly move out of the shadow of the successful
              group, if he was ever in it. In 2006, Rayden participated and won
              the Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos both in Spain and in the
              International Final in Colombia. The great boost of fame for this
              medal and the good reception of the first group album would help
              Rayden to launch a few years later, in 2010 his first professional
              album "Estaba escrito". The album of 14 tracks is already a clear
              example of how Rayden distances himself from the darker and
              heavier style that surrounded him with the group. The evolution of
              the artist from Madrid is very clear from this moment on. In 2012
              would follow his second album "Mosaico", just like the first one,
              edited by Boa Música. In this album Rayden again brings more
              color, clarity and versatility to his style. "En alma y hueso"
              released in 2014 would be Rayden's last album edited by Boa
              Música. Subsequently and with some distance, David Martinez
              Álvarez would speak quite critically about his passage through the
              label par excellence of Spanish Rap, as he has also done about his
              passage through the Red Bull battles.

              At the beginning of 2017, Rayden would open the way towards a
              block of works with a certain closed concept. According to the
              artist himself explains, the album "Antónimo", a hit album
              composed of 14 cuts, represents the first installment of a
              trilogy. More and more, the artist frees himself from the limits
              of being pigeonholed as Spanish Hip Hop, towards a more
              independent Pop-Rock sound, although you have Rap, becoming
              complete songs, are still very present. In January 2019 would
              follow "Sinónimo", the second installment of the trilogy. Again 14
              cuts in which the versatility of the artist comes first. Still
              undated, but already conceived as part of the trilogy, also appear
              a third installment under the man "Homonymous". Although his facet
              as MC or singer is undoubtedly the most cooked of the artist.
              David Martínez Álvarez has also written several books that have
              been as well received as his musical albums. Rayden has also been
              producing music for years. Rayden has produced tracks for his own
              group A3Bandas, for Bajo Minimos, Dogma Crew, Duo Kie, El Chojin
              and many others. However, for years he has only produced for his
              own albums.
